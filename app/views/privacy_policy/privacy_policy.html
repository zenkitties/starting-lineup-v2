        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h3>Our Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>At Swing Smarter & The Starting Lineup, we understand your privacy is important to you, that's why Swing Smarter is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.</p>
        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
        <p>Swing Smarter collects information from our users at several different points on our website. By visiting Swing Smarter and/or The Starting Lineup, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
        <h3>Registration</h3>
        <p>In order to make a purchase on this website, a user must first complete a basic registration form that requires a user to give their first name, last name, country and email address. This information is used to contact the user regarding confirmation of their purchase. We also provide users with the option to sign-up for our newsletter so we can provide them with relevant site information and a more personalized experience.</p>
        <h3>Order</h3>
        <p>We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide financial information including first and last name on the credit card they are using, the credit card type, the credit card number, the credit card expiration date, and the billing address of the card holder. We also request an alternate shipping address if it is not the same as the credit card billing address. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.</p>
        <h3>Shipping and Order Processing</h3>
        <p>We use an outside company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
        <p>We partner with other parties to provide specific services related to the fulfillment of orders from our users. When necessary, we will share names, or other contact information that is required for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we at Swing Smarter & The Starting Lineup are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>
        <h3>Newsletter</h3>
        <p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for their email address as contact information.</p>
        <h3>Surveys & Contests</h3>
        <p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
        <h3>Tell-A-Friend</h3>
        <p>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Swing Smarter will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Swing Smarter and/or The Starting Lineup stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact Swing Smarter at "http://www.swingsmarter.com/":http://www.swingsmarter.com/ to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
        <p>When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information such as credit card number, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link "www.ssl.com":www.ssl.com</p>
        <a href="http://payjunction.com" target="_blank"><img src="/img/creditcards99.gif" /></a>
        <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can <a class="animate-contact-form" target="_self">send an email here.</a></p>
        <h3>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h3>
        <p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes, or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.</p>
        <h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
        <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
